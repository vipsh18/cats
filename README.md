Source Code for Berkeley's CS61A Cats project

The course was not taken as part of Berkeley University's curriculum but rather self-undertaken as part of a skill enhancement course.
The project is a speed test which you can go through to check your typing speed. It can also be played as a multiplayer game.

Clone the repository and run command python3 gui.py or python gui.py to view homepage of the website.
